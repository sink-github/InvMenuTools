# InvMenuTools

**InvMenuTools is a plugin made on API 4.0.0 for MCPE.**
> This was tested on API 4.0.0-BETA3 and MCPE 1.17.30! Note, warranty is not promised.

## What does this do?
> A way to make creating inventories even easier using [Muqsit's InvMenu virion](https://github.com/Muqsit/InvMenu/tree/4.0) for PocketMine-MP.
> Note that this is a developer tool, so don't expect this to anything by itself when put on a server.
